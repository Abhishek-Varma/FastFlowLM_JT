/// \brief asks corelib how it wants Gemma 4's operators padded, for BOTH
///        attention geometries at once, and holds the FOUR attention
///        descriptors a Gemma 4 layer loop can need
///
/// TWO AXES, AND THEY ARE NOT THE SAME KIND OF THING.
///
/// The first is GEOMETRY. Gemma 4 runs two in one stack: sliding-window layers
/// at head_dim 256, full-attention layers at head_dim 512. They resolve
/// DIFFERENT ELFs (`ryzenai_corelib_flat_mha_bf16_desc::head_size` is part of
/// what selects the kernel) and they genuinely have different SHAPES, so a
/// single row-extent table cannot answer for both -- `ForRows(rows, swa)`
/// keeps one per geometry.
///
/// The second is CACHE ROLE: whether a layer owns the KV cache it attends
/// over or reads one an earlier layer wrote (`Gemma4Config::layer_cache_owner`).
/// `kv_shared` selects the "_kvshare" artifacts, which are handed no K operand
/// at all and merge nothing into the cache (corelib.h:1772-1779). This is a
/// 2x2, not a second copy of the geometry split.
///
/// BUT THE ROW EXTENTS DO NOT SPLIT ON THE SECOND AXIS. The header states it
/// outright, as the very reason `flat_mha_bf16_elf_name` exists: the
/// descriptor's "window, kv_shared and scale do not change the shapes of
/// anything -- they change WHICH KERNEL RUNS, by changing the name DD
/// resolves" (corelib.h:1810-1812). So `flat_mha_bf16_pad_rows` cannot depend
/// on `kv_shared`, the owning and sharing families share one row grid per
/// geometry, and `sliding_rows_`/`full_rows_` are correct as two tables rather
/// than four.
///
/// WHY ALL FOUR DESCRIPTORS ARE MATERIALIZED ANYWAY. An earlier version of
/// this plan held two templates with `kv_shared = 0` and left the layer loop
/// to override the field per layer before dispatching. The reference driver
/// keys four descriptors on `(sliding, shares-a-cache)` instead
/// (`ryzenai-corelib/python/gemma4_driver.py:1526-1559`) and says why: "An
/// owning layer given a kvshare descriptor never writes its own cache; a
/// sharing layer given an owning one overwrites somebody else's. Neither
/// errors." A mutated shared template makes that a one-missed-assignment bug
/// with no failure mode; four immutable descriptors and a selecting accessor
/// make it unrepresentable.
