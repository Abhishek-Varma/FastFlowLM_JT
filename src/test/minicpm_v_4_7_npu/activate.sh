#                                # (the thinking turn generates 4x LENGTH)
#
# Why this is needed: the harness links -lminicpm_v_4_7_npu out of src/lib/xrt/, but
# that engine is built in the *other* repo (FastFlowLM_IRON) and is deliberately
# not committed here -- it is a build artifact whose host/NPU flavour changes.
# Without staging it you get:
#     /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lminicpm_v_4_7_npu: No such file or directory
#
# It also exports FLM_MODEL_PATH so the harness finds the model in /scratch
# rather than ~/.config/flm. model_list.json's "model_path" is "models", and
# model_root_path is FLM_MODEL_PATH/models, so point this at the PARENT of the
# model folders.
