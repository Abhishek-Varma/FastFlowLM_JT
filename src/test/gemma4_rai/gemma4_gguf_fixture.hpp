// A synthetic GGUF writer for Gemma 4's two shipped shapes (E2B and E4B).
//
// This is a second, independent implementation of the same GGUF v3 byte
// layout src/test/phi4_rai/gguf_fixture.hpp's Builder writes -- not an
// extraction of it. That header's Builder hardcodes Phi-4's own contract
// metadata in its constructor (general.architecture = "phi3", phi3.* keys, a
// 200064-entry tokenizer.ggml.tokens array...) and is owned by the agent
// working phi4_rai's corelib tests; reusing it here would mean either
// editing a file this task does not own or fighting its Phi-3-shaped
// defaults from the outside for every metadata key gemma4 needs instead.
// A from-scratch, model-agnostic writer -- generic over metadata and
// tensors, carrying no baked-in architecture -- is cleaner for what this
// fixture needs: two files whose overlap with Phi-4's fixture is the
// container format itself, nothing else.
