// A corelib test double scoped to what src/test/gemma4_rai's targets need.
//
// This is a SEPARATE fake from src/test/phi4_rai/fake_corelib.{hpp,cpp} --
// deliberately, not out of preference for "one fake per model". Two concrete
// gaps rule out reusing or extending the Phi-4 fake for Gemma 4's shape-plan
// tests, and both are structural, not stylistic:
//
//   1. Phi-4's `RowsPadCall` records only `{helper, m, k, n, group_size}` --
//      it does not carry the ssmlp weights descriptor's `activation` or
//      `post_feedforward_layernorm` fields at all. Gemma 4's shape plan must
//      pin BOTH (see gemma4_rai_shape_plan.cpp), so a call record that drops
//      them cannot express the assertion.
//   2. None of Phi-4's `MatmulPadCall`/`RowsPadCall`/`MhaPadCall` records the
//      `stream` argument, even though the fake receives it -- there is
//      nothing for "the stream was passed to every pad helper" to compare
//      against.
//
// Editing src/test/phi4_rai/fake_corelib.{hpp,cpp} to add these is out of
// scope here: that fake is owned by another task and its own tests already
// pin its current shape. This file is therefore a full, independent
// implementation of the same `FLM_CORELIB_FUNCTIONS` ABI surface
// (corelib_api.hpp requires every entry to resolve).
//
// WHAT THIS FAKE VALIDATES, AND WHAT IT CANNOT.
//
// Round 1 of review found this file recording calls and validating almost
// nothing while backing the same ABI as the Phi-4 fake, which validates a
// great deal -- and named that gap as the shape that let two Criticals
// through a fully green suite on the Phi-4 side. The checks below were ported
// from that fake and adapted. They are:
//
//   - `create_tensor_window` REJECTS a window that does not fit inside the
//     allocation it is carved from, measured against the ROOT allocation that
//     every window in a chain shares.
//   - `tensor_write` / `tensor_read` REJECT a (count, offset) pair that runs
//     past the tensor's OWN declared extent -- which is what corelib.h says
//     they are bounded by, not the page-rounded allocation behind it.
//   - a dispatch's row-bearing operands must AGREE with each other, and each
//     must carry a row count the matching pad helper is KNOWN to have
//     produced (`State::pad_answers_seen`, via `OnGrid`).
//   - `ryzenai_corelib_ssmlp_bf16` REJECTS two operands that are windows over
//     the SAME backing allocation. Comparison is on backing STORAGE identity
//     (`DispatchRecord::operand_storage`), never on the `void*` handle, since
//     `create_tensor_window` mints a fresh handle every call and two windows
//     onto one allocation therefore compare unequal by handle.
//   - `matmul_pad_shape` can be made to perturb `k`/`n`
//     (`State::matmul_k_delta` / `matmul_n_delta`), so the shape plan's
//     "helper changed padded K/N" rejection is reachable from a test instead
//     of being dead code.
//   - THE PACKED BYTES NAME WHAT WAS PACKED INTO THEM. Every weights object
//     carries a four-byte `identity_tag` taken from its own components;
//     `weights_copy_data` stamps it at offset 0 of the blob it hands out, so
//     the weight cache's file contains it, and each
//     `..._weights_create_from_file` reads it back out of the slice it was
//     given. Without that the CACHE path carries no identity at all -- the
//     descriptor says "some weight of this shape", corelib returns no
//     components -- and `BindFromCache`'s assignment BY SLOT INDEX has
//     nothing watching it. It is also the more faithful model: real corelib's
//     packed bytes are a function of the weight, so two distinct tensors
//     never produce one blob, which the old descriptor-only size was
//     pretending otherwise.
//   - a `flat_mha` / `ssmlp` dispatch RETAINS THE DESCRIPTOR it ran with
//     (`DispatchRecord::mha_desc` / `ssmlp_desc`). Nothing here judges it --
//     see the `kv_shared` bullet below -- but retaining it is what makes an
//     assertion about the value that actually crossed the ABI writable at
//     all, which is what the reference driver's own per-layer `kv_shared`
//     guard needs (`gemma4_driver.py:1670-1690`).
//
// AND HERE IS WHAT IT STILL CANNOT CATCH, stated plainly because this file
// has twice taken a Critical for a comment that read as broader coverage than
// the code delivered:
//
//   - `pad_answers_seen` is filled ONLY by this engine's own calls into these
//     same pad helpers, and `Gemma4ShapePlan::Build()` enumerates EVERY row
//     bucket at construction. So for a helper the plan actually queried (and
//     only for such a helper -- see the `OnGrid` bullet further down), that
//     helper's answer set already holds every bucket's answer by the time any
//     dispatch runs. A dispatch
//     whose operands are UNIFORMLY sized to the wrong bucket -- decode handed
//     bucket 128's rows instead of bucket 1's -- passes both `RowsAgree` and
//     `OnGrid` and would fail on hardware. This is not a gap in the checks;
//     it is a gap the fake CANNOT close, because the live row count a
//     dispatch is meant to use is exactly the argument corelib 0.5.0 removed
//     from the dispatch ABI. Hardware is the only real check.
//   - NOTHING HERE CHECKS THE DESCRIPTOR AGAINST THE SHIPPED KERNEL SET.
//     `flat_mha_pad_rows` records the descriptor and always succeeds. A
//     `scale` or `window` that no artifact ships for -- the exact Critical
//     round 1 found -- is invisible to this fake and is caught only by a test
//     that reads the recorded field itself (see
//     TestAttentionScaleIsExactlyOneEverywhere) or by real hardware.
//   - `kv_shared` likewise. The fake cannot TELL an owning dispatch given a
//     kvshare descriptor from a correct one; neither can corelib -- both
//     buffers exist, both are the right shape, and the kernel that runs is
//     simply a different one. What the fake now does is RECORD the value that
//     crossed the ABI (`DispatchRecord::mha_desc`), which is a strictly
//     weaker thing and is the whole of the improvement: it moves the check
//     from impossible to writable, and leaves writing it to the caller. The
//     reference driver writes exactly that check host-side, against
//     `cfg.kv_layers`, and raises at load rather than at the first prompt
//     (`gemma4_driver.py:1670-1690`); C7 should port it. Until it does, the
//     only thing pinning `kv_shared` is the descriptor-level assertions in
//     test_gemma4_shape_plan.cpp.
//   - THE IDENTITY ON THE CACHE LEG IS FOUR BYTES, NOT THE WHOLE COMPONENT.
//     `identity_tag` is one block tag, or one BF16 gamma element, or (for
//     ssmlp) the gate stream's tag alone -- enough to say WHICH weight, never
//     enough to say the whole of it was right. Two norms agreeing in their
//     first element and differing later are one weight to a cache-bound
//     engine here; so are two ssmlp blobs whose gates agree and whose ups do
//     not. Neither can occur against this fixture (every F32 tensor is
//     constant-filled, every Q8_0 tensor's tag is unique) and the pack leg
//     still checks the full gamma and all three block streams. On a real
//     packed blob the content IS the weight, so the gap is the fake's, not
//     the design's.
//   - The row grid here is one flat "round up to 64, except M == 1" rule for
//     every op. Real corelib ships a different grid per op and per shape. A
//     bug that depends on two ops' grids genuinely differing cannot be seen
//     here.
//   - `OnGrid` REJECTS a matmul output width nothing ever queried a pad
//     answer for. That is only sound while the plan queries every width the
//     engine will dispatch: a width the plan misses is a FALSE REJECTION of a
//     correct dispatch, not a missing check. It has already happened once --
//     lm_head's `hidden -> vocab` was unqueried and C7's first dispatch was
//     refused -- which is why `Gemma4ShapePlan::Build()` now plans lm_head.
//     Read OnGrid's own comment in fake_corelib.cpp before adding a dispatch
//     at a width the plan does not query.
//   - The write/read bound above holds only for objects that HAVE a declared
//     shape. `WithinExtent` returns true when the shape is empty, and every
//     object minted by `matmul_weights_create_*`, `ssmlp_weights_create_*`,
//     `create_stream` and `MakeStreamForTest` has an empty shape -- so a
//     `tensor_write`/`tensor_read` aimed at one of those is UNBOUNDED here.
//     DEFERRED, not overlooked: corelib's weights and stream objects are not
//     tensors and no correct engine writes through them, so tightening it
//     would be guarding a path that only misuse reaches. Stated because the
//     bullet above reads, on its own, as an unqualified guarantee.
//   - `create_tensor_window` applies its fit check only when the parent has
//     storage. A window carved from a NULL parent has none, skips the check,
//     and then also slips past `AllDistinctStorage`, which skips
//     storage-less operands. Misuse rather than a live path; deferred for the
//     same reason.
//   - `MatmulHelperFor` keys on the output width N ALONE, so two matmuls with
//     the same N and different K share one grid entry. GEMMA 4 HAS SUCH A
//     PAIR, so this is not hypothetical: the output projection is
//     `q_heads*head_dim -> hidden` on a sliding layer and
//     `q_heads*global_head_dim -> hidden` on a full one -- 2048->1536 and
//     4096->1536 on E2B -- and both land on `"matmul-1536"`. Nothing else
//     collides on either shipped row (E2B queries N in {2048, 4096, 256, 512,
//     1536, 262144}; E4B in {2048, 4096, 512, 1024, 2560, 262144}).
//     DEFERRED: with one shared row rule here the two entries would hold the
//     same answers anyway, so keying on (K, N) would buy nothing today. It
//     would start to matter the moment this fake models per-shape grids.
//   - `release_order` RECORDS AN ORDER; IT DOES NOT MODEL THE FAULT. corelib
//     access-violates somewhere inside `ryzenai_corelib_object_release` when
//     an object outlives its Stream, and this fake's `object_release` is a
//     `delete` that cannot and does not reproduce that. So a green
//     release-order test says "this engine releases in the order that was
//     measured not to fault", NEVER "this engine does not fault". Nothing in
//     this project has torn a Gemma 4 engine down against real corelib.
//   - `fail_dispatch_at` INJECTS a status; it does not model a reason. The
//     engine's own comment says a mid-chain rejection against real corelib
//     is PROCESS-FATAL -- the unwind destructs runs whose commands are still
//     in flight and XRT aborts uncatchably. Here the unwind is clean, so a
//     test can observe `poisoned()` at all. What the test proves is that the
//     FLAG is set on that path, never that the path is survivable.
//     The same caveat covers `fail_dispatch_at = 0`, which C9's fix round
//     uses for the other half of the definition: it shows that the engine
//     does not POISON when its first dispatch is refused, and says nothing
//     about whether real corelib can refuse one without having enqueued it.
//   - `nonfinite_read_index` NARROWS the NaN injection to one read so the
//     engine's SECOND `RequireFinite` call site is reachable at all. It
//     chooses which guard fires; it does not make a NaN at that point
//     plausible, and no test may read anything into WHY the logits would be
//     non-finite while the hidden state was not.
//
// One further, load-bearing absence: there is no `ple_pad_calls` here, and
// there never will be. The pinned corelib.h has no
// `ryzenai_corelib_ple_bf16_pad_rows` (or any other ple padding entry point)
// at all -- ple_bf16's own doc comment says M "comes from `x`'s own extent
// and SELECTS THE KERNEL", implicitly, with no helper to ask. So the shape
// plan computes `ple_rows` (and, by the same reasoning, `rmsnorm_rows`) from
// a local, hardcoded bucket table taken verbatim from corelib.h's own
// ple_bf16 comment, never from a corelib call -- there is nothing here to
// fake.
//
// THE PLE AND RMSNORM *WEIGHTS* ENTRY POINTS ARE A DIFFERENT MATTER AND ARE
// FAKED FOR REAL. An earlier version of this paragraph said
// `FLM_CORELIB_FUNCTIONS` "has no ple or rmsnorm entries either", which was
// true when C6 wrote it and is not any more: C7 added
// `ple_bf16_weights_pack`/`_create`/`ple_bf16` and
// `rmsnorm_bf16_weights_create_reference`/`_from_file`/`rmsnorm_bf16`,
// because Gemma 4 dispatches both operators every layer. What this fake does
// with them:
//
//   - `ple_bf16_weights_pack` HONOURS THE TWO-CALL PROTOCOL. `out == NULL`
//     reports the size and dereferences none of the four arrays, and records
//     (`PlePackCall::read_any_array`) that it did not, so "the engine sized
//     its buffer before it held the data" is a checkable claim rather than a
//     comment. It also refuses `group_size != 32`, which is the only value
//     mladfple ships.
//   - it RETAINS `post_norm` and `next_norm` in full. `next_norm` is the
//     NEXT layer's attention-norm gamma and the off-by-one there still
//     generates text, so it has to be assertable per layer. The layer a pack
//     call belongs to is read off `desc.layer_scale`, which the fixture
//     makes unique per layer.
//   - `rmsnorm_bf16_weights_create_reference` retains the whole BF16 gamma,
//     so "V's norm is a vector of exactly 1.0" is checkable rather than
//     assumed.
//   - `ple_bf16` and `rmsnorm_bf16` ARE RECORDED AS DISPATCHES, which until
//     Task R3 they were not: only matmul / ssmlp / mha minted a
//     `DispatchRecord` and everything else fell through the generic success
//     branch. A Gemma 4 layer is SEVEN dispatches on a sharing layer and
//     `10 + kv_heads` on an owning one -- 11 on E2B, 12 on E4B -- of which
//     these two ops are 3 of 7 and 5 of 11 (6 of 12) respectively, so C8's
//     layer loop would have been measured by an instrument blind to roughly
//     HALF of it. (An earlier version of this comment said "ten and six":
//     those are the WEIGHT-OBJECT counts from gemma4_rai.hpp:40-47, correct
//     for weights and wrong for dispatches. Counted from gemma4_driver.py
//     :2254-2336.) Each
//     carries its operands in the header's own order, their backing STORAGE
//     identity, the weights object it ran with, and its position in
//     `State::dispatches`, which is ABI call order.
//   - `ple_bf16` enforces what its section of corelib.h states: `out` and
//     `norm_out` distinct from each other and from `x` (on storage, not on
//     handles), and a row count the ELF set actually ships -- see OnPleGrid,
//     which is stricter than corelib on purpose.
//   - `rmsnorm_bf16` enforces NEITHER of those, and the absences are real
//     rather than pending: in-place is explicitly legal for small M, and
//     `rmsnorm_bf16_pad_rows` is an identity function that is not even bound
//     in FLM_CORELIB_FUNCTIONS, so there is no grid to check against. See the
//     dispatch branch in fake_corelib.cpp for both, written out.
//   - `weights_copy_data` now reports a real (small, synthetic) size instead
//     of 0. It used to report 0 unconditionally, which silently disabled the
//     weight cache's whole write path.

///        accepts
/// \note A SMALL, DETERMINISTIC STAND-IN, not corelib's real packed size.
///       Real ple blobs are ~1 MB per layer and the weight-cache test writes
///       every packed weight to a file; using realistic sizes would make
///       that test write gigabytes to prove a bookkeeping property. What the
///       number has to be is (a) the same for the same descriptor and (b)
///       different for different ones, so that a cache entry written for one
///       weight cannot be bound to another. Exposed so a test can assert the
///       two-call protocol's reported size is what the second leg is then
///       given, rather than duplicating the formula.
